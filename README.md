<b>Redirect to your own NGINX web server and setup SSL.</b>
<br><br>
This guide assumes that you have already setup NGINX, configured nginx.conf and have a website that you want to redirect to. We are doing this redirection server-side and not on an application level.
<br><br>
Other prerequisites:<br>
- [x] You've set an "A" (HTTP) redirect from your web hotel to your own public IP of the webserver.
- [x] Your webserver is up and running and you have an example.com website on it (for eg. in /var/www/example.com/).

<b>Why even bother?</b><br>
Without SSL, your website will show insecure to the visitors. SSL encrypts requests made between a web server and a visitors browser and it also make requests and responsens happen in a way so that they can't be intercepted. The certificates that is being authenticated makes sure that the certificate isn't intended for a different domain, if so the user will get alerted and the browser will most likely block the request. Users today expect a secure and private online experience when using a website. It is more or less default nowadays to use TLS/SSL (HTTPS).<br><br>

Google has written a [great article](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6073543?hl=en) on this. In short it provides three key layers of protection: <br><br>
1. Encryption — encrypting the exchanged data to keep it secure from eavesdroppers. That means that while the user is browsing a website, nobody can "listen" to their conversations, track their activities across multiple pages, or steal their information.<br>
2. Data integrity — data cannot be modified or corrupted during transfer, intentionally or otherwise, without being detected<br>
3. Authentication — proves that your users communicate with the intended website. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks and builds user trust, which translates into other business benefits.<br>

Previously, one only had to redirect from an www.example.com to example.com and/or vice-versa. Since the implementation of HTTPS we now have 4 options to enter a website that we have to take in considiration.<br>
<br>
http://example.com &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP<br>
https://example.com &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTPS<br>
http://www.example.com &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP + "www"<br>
https://www.example.com &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTPS + "www"<br><br>
<b>Let's Encrypt!</b></br>
To be able to redirect your HTTP to HTTPS you will need valid certificates.

<b>Certificate done, whats next?!</b><br>
Here are the bits and bops that you need to add to your example.com.conf file. If this is unclear, please check my own example file example.com.conf in this repository for further details. <br>
<br>
```
  server {
  listen 80;
  server_name example.com www.example.com;
  return 301 https://example.com$request_uri;
}

server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name example.com www.example.com;

  # ssl configuration
  ssl on;
  ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private.key;

  if ($http_host = www.example.com) {
    return 301 https://example.com$request_uri;
  }
}
```
